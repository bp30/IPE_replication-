BACKGROUND: 
IPE is a replication to Gaesser and Schacter (2014) that aimed to replicate prosocial simulation effect (PSE) (i.e., imagine helping a person will lead to an increase in willingness to help him/her) in NZ with tighter experimental control (ensure that participants are simulating a different person on each imagine helping trial). The following research questions were assess:

1. Replication the PSE in willingness to help when the unqiue identity of the person in need is made explicit.
2. Replicate the modulating effect vividness of the simulated events plays in PSE.
3. Examine whether Perspective taking mediate the PSE effect in willingness to help.
4. Examine whether there is moderated mediation for perspective taking on PSE across conditions.
5. Assess whether participant level emotion reaction modulated the PSE in willingness to help (exploratory)
6. Bayesian cumulative mixed model replication of questions 1, 2 and 5.

IPE_analysis.rmd contains most updated scripts for analyses in IPE. A list of measures collected from the experiments are included in IPE_analysis.rmd. In addition, Bayes_scripts.R and LMM_scripts.R can be found IPE_IPEF_Analysis folder.
